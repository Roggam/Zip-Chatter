#Passion Project: Zip Chatter

Zip Chatter is a communication/chat web app with an easy-to-use UI that you can use to collaborate with others; it was designed to replace email as your primary method of communication and sharing.

After a simple signup process, youâ€™ll be able to invite your team to join and start getting work done. You can send direct messages, create channels, search, reply to threads, sends emojis, and share files.  


I will be using React, Node.js, Stream API (#1 Chat API), Heroku(back-end) and Netlify(front-end)
